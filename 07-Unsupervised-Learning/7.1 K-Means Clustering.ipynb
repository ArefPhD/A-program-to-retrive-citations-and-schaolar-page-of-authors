        "In many applications, observations need to be divided into similar groups based on observed features. For example, retailers may want to divide potential customers into groups, in order to target a marketing campaign at the customers who are most likely to respond positively. This practice is known as _market segmentation_.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general problem of grouping observations based on observed features is known as _clustering_ in machine learning. Like the classification problems of Chapter 6, clustering is about dividing observations into categories based on features. Unlike classification, we do not have ground truth labels that specify what the categories should be; they have to be inferred from the data. In other words, with classification, the training data contains both features $X$ and labels $y$; with clustering, the training data only contains features $X$.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this reason, clustering is an example of an _unsupervised learning_ problem, in contrast to the _supervised learning_ problems of the previous chapters. This terminology comes from the following analogy to human learning.  Imagine a child that is trying to learn the difference between shapes and has several examples of each shape in front of him.\n",

Regression and classification are both examples of _supervised learning_ because labels are available in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the child may be _unsupervised_ and completely left to his own devices. Eventually, he may figure out that there is something similar about all of the circles that distinguish them from the squares. But he won't know that they are called \"circles\", nor will he know whether he is right or not. This is the fundamental challenge of unsupervised learning. Clustering is an example of _unsupervised learning_ because labels are not available in the training data.\n",
